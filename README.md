accounts for 12 million individuals.Travelling alone and interacting with
surroundings are extremely challenging tasks for them.


• Constantly depending on another person for basic necessities is not always
convenient.Blind people are often scammed and mislead, thus they need
assistance for security insurance to be self-reliant.


• Visually impaired people face challenges in completing their daily chores and
interacting with their surroundings.


• The proposed model “Drishti” introduces a modular smart glass with AI
assistance that will facilitate the visually challenged person in their daily
activities.

front of the user.


● Reading Mode: Read texts/ Signboards and use of text to speech conversion to
provide real-time feedback to the user. Currency detection feature is also included
in this.


● SOS Mode: In case of an emergency, an alert will be sent to contact the guardian.


● Google Assistant Mode: In this mode user can access a virtual assistant to
